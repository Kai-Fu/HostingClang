HostingClang
=======

I assume you know at least Clang is a C++ compiler, otherwise you are wasting time here.

If you have experience of developing software with embedded scripting language support like Python and Lua, you probably know what I mean by hosting Clang?

Yes, what Iâ€™m doing in this tutorial-like project here is to demonstrate the ability of making C++ an embedded language for the application you are developing. 

Python and Lua are natively supporting being embedded since they are open source and their interpreters are portable to most platforms. 
Recently C# becomes popular for embedded game play language because of Unity3D. You probably know Unity3D is built on the top of Mono as the cross-platform JIT engine of C# language.

Now what about C++? 

With Clang and LLVM infrastructure, , not only does it become possible, but brings you the rich assets in C++ code as well the exciting performance advantages over those script languages.
